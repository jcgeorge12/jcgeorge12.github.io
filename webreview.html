    <h1>Reviweing two good and one bad website.</h1>


    <h3>
        The first website that we will be reviewing will be Cabela’s.com. When you open the page, you can see that the layout is good. This is at full page. It has got two rows that you can click on to find things. The search button works well. Nothing is more frustrating then when you try to search for something and you have to fight with the search bar. I like the way the page is laid out. It is clear where everything is. Everything on the page is linked. It is clear when your curser is over something. The pictures are in good spots. I like that at the top of the page they have the picture that rotates through five different ads. You have the chose to pick which one you want. When you make the page go smaller it still flows great. You do not have to scroll left or right at all. All the buttons at the top go into the three little bars and you just have to click on that to find everything that was in the heading of the full page. I think it is very easy to get around the page. The source page looks clean. With the little bit of experience that I have with the source page, I can understand it. I can look at it and the see it on the page. Great web page.

    <h3> The second website that we will look at is Bobward’s.com. When opening the page, it looks clean. The big logo brings you back to the home page. It has 6 sections on the header and then your cart button. When you click on one of the header buttons it has a drop down. The only thing that I notice is you have to be directly over the top to the subsection. There is no playroom. That is the only thing that I found that was not very friendly. It shows the product very well. It has the same thing as Cabela did with the pictures that scroll automatic. You just pick one and click it. When you scroll down the page it has several different sections that the header didn’t have. Which is nice. When you make the page small it compresses nicely. No need to scroll left or right. The header goes to the three little lines. It works great as well. The source page looks clean and I can understand and follow it. I like that is has a section on the main page that is called seasonal picks. When you bring the page up or click on something, it loads fast, no lag time. The product display is great. They are big and the price is displayed. You don’t have to click on it to find out how much is cost. This is a good local website. </h3>

    <h3>One of the websites that I was not impressed by was Montana Outdoor Sports. When you build a website for a retail store, you need to be able to shop on that said website. That is not the case with this website. When you go to the home page it is very plain. There is a beautiful Montana picture. That is the only thing about the website that looks good. If you want to see what product they have you have to options. One, go into the store or email then and hope they get back to you. We live in Montana, where you may have to drive an hour to town. If you live that far out and are looking for something, then you want to see if they have it before you drive in. When you go to the shopping tab, you’re not able to shop, just read a little about each department. The background is just white. There is no color to the website. It seems that the person that put this website together was an employee. I understand this is a small store but if you had the ability to see what they have on their shelves then they would have more business.</h3>
