    <h1> Reviewing 5 State Websites</h1>

    <h2>My number one pick is Iowa. The page has a good flow to it. The page is easy to navigate. It has infromation on the page that I have not seen on any other page. Like Unemployment, Income and Graduation rates. It also has Facts about Iowa. Which I found cool. </h2>
    <h2>The State of Iowa</h2>
    <h4>Loads slow. Loads to big. But after loading you and make it big or small and see all the infromation. The website ahs some good infromation on the main page. Things that you might not ask about, but is good info to know. The drop down menu is plain and when you click on one of the topics it loads slow. </h4>

    <h2> I would pick Alaska as my second pick. The page loads fast and has alot of cool things about it. However, the page does not work in smaller sizes or you can't see the whole page. </h2>
    <h2>The State of Alaska</h2>
    <h4>The page loads fast. When you make it smaller the page stops about half way and you can"t see the whole page. The Nav bar is good. Each one drops down and you can see what your selecting. I like how they have the three sections hiden till you take your moose over them. They have top links and how do i in each one of those sections. When you click on a link it takes you to it fast. No waiting time. it seems that they have lots of main points on the first page. Which in turn makes it easy to find things. The page source looks clean and tighty.</h4>

    <h2>Tennessee would be my third chose. This page has great varity on it. The page just loads slow. That is every time you load a new page. </h2>
    <h2>The State of Tennessee.</h2>
    <h4>Most of the page loads fast expect the Part of the page the scrolls throw 7 differetn pages or pictures. The menu is clean and easy to see. When clicking on a menu botton it takes some time to load. When makeing it small or big you can see all the infromation. There is a varity of different buttons, shape and sizes. The page is not overwheming. The main page has lots of infromtaion right there for you to see. The source page is very neat. </h4>

    <h2>Vermot page is just plain. There is not many things on the main page. Which means that you have to go find it. Its better then Oklahoma. </h2>
    <h2>The State of Vermot</h2>
    <h4>Loads slow.It has big tiles on the main page. Big search bar on full page. The menu bar is nice and big in full screen. When you reduces the size it goes to three little lines. The source page looks busy. </h4>

    <h2>This page is the smallest of home pages. They have seven bottons on the main page and thats all. You have to search for things or go to the menu, which is not even called the menu. Its called State Agencies. </h2>
    <h2> The State of Oklahoma</h2>
    <h4>The page loads fast. The main page is simple. Not much to it. There is no menu button. Just a State Agencies button. The page will reduce and get bigger when you make the page go in and out. You can use it in any size. It had a three sliding pages at the top. When you go to the state agencies page and then slecet a topice it loads super slow. When you click on Oklahoma School of Science page the header/Menu dose not move with the page, so when you scroll down in gets in the way. When you put it in half page or double screen the menu part disapers. </h4>
